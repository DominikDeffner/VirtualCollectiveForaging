human collectives****


***Software requirements***
The analysis code was written in R 4.0.3. Statistical models are fit using the Stan MCMC engine via the rstan (2.21.2) and cmdstanr (0.5.3) packages, which require a C++ compiler. Installation  instructions are available at https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started and https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/articles/cmdstanr.html. See also the Stan user guide at https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation. The rethinking package (2.12) is required to process fitted model outputs (installation instructions at http://xcelab.net/rm/software/).
